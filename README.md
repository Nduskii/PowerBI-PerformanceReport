**Overview**  

Executive-level profitability analysis designed to explain **what drove Gross Profit performance**.
The dashboard allows stakeholders to dynamically switch between **Gross Profit, Sales, and Quantity** to diagnose whether performance changes were driven by pricing, volume, or mix effects.


## Business Objective
To evaluate 2023 commercial performance by:
- Measuring **YTD vs PYTD Gross Profit**
- Assessing **margin efficiency (GP%)**
- Identifying underperforming markets and accounts
- Distinguishing **revenue-driven vs margin-driven performance**


## Key Highlights
- **+2.43M YTD vs PYTD Gross Profit growth**
- **39.62% GP%**, indicating stable margin control
- Sales declined **(-512K YoY)** while Gross Profit increased, signaling **improved margin quality**
- Quantity growth (**+17.05K units**) supported profitability despite revenue pressure


## Dashboard Capabilities
- Metric toggle (Gross Profit / Sales / Quantity) for profit driver analysis
- Monthly YTD vs PYTD waterfall to explain performance contribution
- Bottom-performing country analysis for targeted intervention
- Product-level trend analysis by month
- Account segmentation using **GP% vs Value** to identify optimization opportunities


## Tools & Skills
- Power BI Desktop
- Advanced DAX (YTD, PYTD, variance, GP%)
- Financial & commercial performance analysis
- Executive dashboard design

## Business Insights & Recommendations
- Gross Profit growth despite declining Sales suggests improved pricing discipline and product mix optimization.
- Stable GP% (~39.6%) indicates effective cost control even as volume increased.
- Underperforming countries should be reviewed for pricing, cost structure, or demand-side constraints rather than blanket cost reduction.
- High-revenue, low-margin accounts present immediate opportunities for margin improvement through pricing or contract renegotiation.
